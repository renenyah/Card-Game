# Card-Game
This is a simple card game between two players. The game uses a standard 52-card deck; there are four suits and each suit has 13 ranks. For simplicity, we use numbers to identify cards
Thus, we have suits 1, 2, 3, and 4, and ranks from 1 to 13 (inclusive). Each card is identified by its suit number followed by its rank. The game begins with the dealer shuffling the deck then distributing the cards to the two players. The players then take turns in placing their cards on the table, one card a time, starting with place 1, followed by place 2, etc.; when a player places a card in place 4, the next player places their card in place 1, and so on. The game continues until both players finish their cards. At the end it will count the number of pairs of matching cards they have collected in their banks, and the winner is the player with more pairs (the most points). If there is a tie, then for simplicity we can consider player 1 to be the winner
